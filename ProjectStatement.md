## Team member selections - list
- Haris Vidimlic
- Paul Sciarpelletti
- Abhiek Bist

## Provide a description of the project you are going to undertake
- We will be making a Bike Trails forum for BC, specifically Kelowna
- It is an interactive forum that will provide a trail rating, along with
beginner, novice and intermediate status ratings along with
comments for an informative and interactive style forum.

## Requirements list of what (at a minimum) your site will do
- Bikers will be able to search the Kelowna area for various trails
- There should be a quick summary of all the important info regarding
the trail (length, difficulty, rating, map) for each trail on the main
page, open to all users to browse.
- Users without accounts can also view the forum posts but cannot
write their own without creating an account first.
- Users with accounts will have their comments and interactions
saved to a database, they will also have the power to delete their
own old comments.
- Administrator privileges will allow certain users to add/delete users,
view unavailable data that normal users arenâ€™t privy to
